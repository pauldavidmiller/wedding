  /*
    Embedding a Zoom call into a React website can enhance user engagement, allowing visitors to join meetings directly from your platform. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to achieve this:

    Step 1: Setting Up Your Zoom Account
    Create a Zoom Meeting: Log in to your Zoom account and schedule a meeting. Note the Meeting ID and the meeting link.

    Enable Embed Features: Ensure that your Zoom account settings allow for embedding. You may need to check the "Embed the join URL" option under the meeting settings.

    Step 2: Generating an Embed Code
    While Zoom does not provide a straightforward embed code like some video platforms, you can use the meeting link in an iframe to create an embedded experience.

    Additional Considerations
      Permissions: Users will need to allow camera and microphone access for full functionality.
      Mobile Responsiveness: Ensure your iframe and component styles are responsive for better usability on mobile devices.
      Security: Be cautious about sharing meeting links publicly; consider using passwords for meetings to enhance security.
